  <h1>ðŸŒŒ MdMap</h1>
  <p>
    MdMap is a lock-free data structure that can act as a replacment for  e.g. Mutex&lt;HashMap&gt; or DashMap
  </p>

<sub>ðŸš§ UNSTABLE ðŸš§ <br> MdMap has not been thoroughly tested and is likely filled with bugs</sub>

</div>

Items in MdMap are stored in a multi-dimensional linked list.
This makes it possible to achieve logarithmic search performance while allowing many threads to operate on the list in parallel.
An effect of the multi-dimensional list is that keys are sorted, which makes this suitable for things like priority queues.

## Performance

Other concurrent data structures builds on sharding (e.g. `DashMap`).
Doing this on a few keys, such as with an exponential key distribution can lead to a lot of lock contention and poor performance.

Skiplists is another alternative commonly used for concurrent data structures, however concurrency in
these can be limited under write-heavy loads.

MdMap uses multi-dimensional linked lists (which makes it more of a `MdTreeMap` perhaps) where scalar keys
acts as coordinates into the underlying structure. This has a couple of befits over other approaches, where MdMap doesn't require
balancing (seen in e.g. BSTs), randomization (e.g. skiplists) nor mutex-based locks (e.g. shard based).
This makes it quite fast under some loads compared to other solutions.

**Disclaimer**: MdMap is still under development and I am working on improving its performance. It's still pretty
slow for most workloads, but looks quite promising :)

### Benchmarks

Here are some _experimental_ and **INCREDIBLY BIASED** benchmarks, where we see that MdMap performs really when pressure is high on just a few keys.

**Exponential key distribution**

```
[config]
map size: 1000 entries (prefilled)
operation distribution: 98% get; 2% insert
operationg on: [672, 123, 493, 192, 12, 803, 366, 44, 982, 500]
executing: 3000 ops
key distribution: `exponential`
key distribution summary:
---------------------------------
| key |    ops     | percentage |
=================================
| 672 | ~    0 ops |    0.0078% |
| 123 | ~    0 ops |    0.0156% |
| 493 | ~    1 ops |    0.0546% |

| 982 | ~  697 ops |   23.2558% |
| 500 | ~ 1897 ops |   63.2355% |
--------------------------------

**Uniform key distribution**

```
[config]
map size: 1000 entries (prefilled with 0..1000)
operation distribution: 98% get; 2% insert
operationg on: [672, 123, 493, 192, 12, 803, 366, 44, 982, 500]
executing: 3000 ops
key distribution: `uniform`
key distribution summary:

| 982 | ~  300 ops |   10.0000% |
